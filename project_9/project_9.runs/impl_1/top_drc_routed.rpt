CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1840 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U1/U2/U1/MAR_reg[4]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U1/U2/U1/data_out_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell U1/U2/U1/data_out_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U1/U2/U2/IR_Load_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U1/U2/U2/IR_Load_reg_i_1/O, cell U1/U2/U2/IR_Load_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 U1/U1/U2/RW_reg has an input control pin U1/U1/U2/RW_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: U1/U1/U2/Q[6]) which is driven by a register (U1/U2/U1/MAR_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
